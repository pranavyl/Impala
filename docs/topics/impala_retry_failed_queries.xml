  <conbody>
    <p>Use the <codeph>RETRY_FAILED_QUERIES</codeph> query option to control
      whether or not queries are transparently retried on cluster membership
      changes. </p>
    <p>Cluster membership changes typically occur when an impalad crashes, or if the node is
      blacklisted by the Impala Coordinator. If a SELECT query fails due to a cluster membership
      change, the Coordinator will cancel and unregister the running query and then launch a retry
      of the query. For example, if one of the executor nodes fails during query execution, the query
      fails but is transparently re-executed, either with the executor node immediately replaced, or
      with a temporarily reduced number of executor nodes. This feature supports retrying the
      entire query and NOT the individual query fragments. INSERT and DDL queries will NOT be
      retried.</p>
    <p>Note that query retry will be skipped if the query has returned any results to the client. To
      avoid this, enable <codeph>Result Spooling</codeph> and set the
        <codeph>spool_all_results_for_retries</codeph> query option.</p>
