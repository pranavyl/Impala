   <indexterm audience="hidden">USE_NULL_SLOTS_CACHE Query Option</indexterm> Impala
   optimizes expressions that contain null-rejecting conjuncts - expressions that are
   false if all "slots" (values returned from a table) are <codeph>NULL</codeph>.
   Evaluating whether a conjunct is null-rejecting can be expensive when performed over a
   lot of expressions. The "null slots cache" speeds analysis of generated queries with
   many similar expressions by caching the result of evaluating an expression after slots
   have been replaced with <codeph>NULL</codeph>s.
  </p>

  <p>
   If query analysis uses a lot of memory, performance of the "null slots cache" can be
   reviewed by enabling logging <codeph>org.apache.impala.analysis.Analyzer=DEBUG</codeph>
   and searching coordinator logs for messages like
  </p>

<codeblock>
null slots cache size: 286, median entry: 4416.0, 99th entry: 252688.88, hit rate: 0.99456364
