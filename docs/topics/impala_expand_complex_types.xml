  <p>
   <indexterm audience="hidden">EXPAND_COMPLEX_TYPES Query Option</indexterm> Older versions of
   Impala did not support complex types in the select list, and therefore a <codeph>SELECT
   *</codeph> statement only expanded to primitive types even when the table contained complex-typed
   columns. Support for complex types in the select list has since been added, but for backward
   compatibility the behaviour that <q>*</q> expressions skip complex types has been kept as the
   default. If the EXPAND_COMPLEX_TYPES query option is set to true, <q>*</q> expressions will
   include complex types as well.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note: even if EXPAND_COMPLEX_TYPES is false, complex-typed columns that are listed explicitly in
   the select list (i.e. not as a <q>*</q> expression) will be included in the result.
  </p>

  <p><b>Type:</b>BOOLEAN</p>
  <p><b>Default:</b>FALSE</p>
  <p><b>Added in:</b>Impala 4.2</p>
