  <p>
   <indexterm audience="hidden">UTF8_MODE Query Option</indexterm> UTF-8 support allows string
   functions to recognize the UTF-8 characters, thus processing strings in a compatible way as other
   engines.</p>
  <p>You can use the new query option, UTF8_MODE, to turn on/off the UTF-8 aware behavior. The query
   option can be set globally, or at per session level. Only queries with UTF8_MODE=true will have
   UTF-8 aware behaviors. If the query option UTF8_MODE is turned on globally, existing queries that
   depend on the original binary behavior need to be explicitly set to UTF8_MODE=false.</p>

  <p><b>Type:</b>BOOLEAN</p>
  <p><b>Default:</b>FALSE</p>
  <p><b>Added in:</b>Impala 4.1</p>
