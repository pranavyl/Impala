minimum memory reservation is greater than memory available to the
 query for buffer reservations. Memory reservation needed given the
 current plan: 68.09 MB. Adjust the MEM_LIMIT option for the query to allow the query
 memory limit to be at least 100.09 MB. Note that changing the memory limit
 may also change the plan. See 'Per Host Min Memory Reservation' in the query
 profile for more information about the per-node memory requirements.
