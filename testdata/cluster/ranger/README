RANGER-4771.diff and IMPALA-12921_addendum.diff are provided with IMPALA-12921 to
facilitate the verification of the results of authorization-related tests when we build
Apache Impala on the master branch (with tip being
https://github.com/apache/impala/commit/1233ac3) with Apache Ranger on the master branch
(with tip being https://github.com/apache/ranger/commit/4abb993).
After applying these 2 patches, we only found the following 3 failed tests. They failed
because the support for storage handler privileges is not yet supported by Apache Ranger
and hence the test cases added in IMPALA-10436 could fail.

1. TestRanger::test_show_grant() in test_ranger.py.
2. TestRanger::test_grant_revoke_with_role() in test_ranger.py.
3. AuthorizationStmtTest#testCreateTable() in AuthorizationStmtTest.java.

In what follows we give more details regarding why these 2 patches are required to verify
the results of authorization-related tests when we build Apache Impala with Apache
Ranger.

RANGER-4771.diff should be applied to Apache Ranger on the master branch (with tip being
https://github.com/apache/ranger/commit/4abb993) so that an Impala administrator could
manage policies using GRANT/REVOKE statements in the Impala shell in the non-Kerberized
environment. Recall that currently in Impala's development environment, we run the
authorization-related tests without Kerberos.

IMPALA-12921_addendum.diff should be applied due to the following reasons.

1. fe/pom.xml needs to be patched to prevent the compilation of Impala's frontend from
   failing. This is done by excluding the hive-storage-api dependency that is
   transitively pulled in by ranger-plugins-audit because the locally built
   ranger-plugins-audit could pull in an incompatible version of hive-storage-api.
2. Various files have to be patched to add a startup flag
   'support_storage_type_in_ranger'. This flag is needed because when it is set to false,
   a) the catalog server will not send to the Ranger server a GrantRevokeRequest
   involving the resource type of 'storage-type' (e.g., in GRANT ALL ON SERVER TO USER
   <grantee>), and b) the coordinator will skip the check for the privileges on resources
   of type 'storage-type' (e.g., when the ALL privilege on SERVER is registered in a
   query).
3. AuthorizationTestBase.java and test_ranger.py have to be patched to set
   'support_storage_type_in_ranger' to false when we start the coordinators and the
   catalog server.
