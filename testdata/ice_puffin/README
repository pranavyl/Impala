This directory contains metadata files matching an Iceberg table created with the
following command

  CREATE TABLE ice_puffin (
    int_col1 INT,
    int_col2 INT,
    bigint_col BIGINT,
    float_col FLOAT,
    double_col DOUBLE,
    decimal_col DECIMAL,
    date_col DATE,
    string_col STRING,
    timestamp_col TIMESTAMP,
    bool_col BOOLEAN) STORED BY ICEBERG;

The metadata.json and the avro files are taken from a table created with the above command
and then truncated (truncation is needed so that a snapshot exists).

The metadata files in the "generated" subdirectory are created with the
PuffinDataGenerator tool in "java/puffin-data-generator". The metadata.json file here is
used by that tool as a template.
To re-generate the metadata files, run the following from the Impala home directory:

  (pushd java/puffin-data-generator; mvn -DskipTests install) && \
  mvn -f "java/puffin-data-generator/pom.xml" exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.impala.puffindatagenerator.PuffinDataGenerator";

This will generate files in the "puffin_files" directory, which must previously be empty
or non-existent. The generated files can then be copied into the "generated" subdirectory
here.
